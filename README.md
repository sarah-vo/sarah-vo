#### Hi there! I'm Sarah (She/Her) 🏳️‍🌈 🇻🇳! Nice to meet you 👋

- 🔭 I'm looking for a software engineer internship/co-op.
- 🎓 I'm a fourth year student at SFU in BC studying Computing Science.
- 📖 I have experience in full-stack web development, as well as embedded development. Check out my profile for more information.
- 🧠 I'm also tinkering on Rust (the programming language, not the game), and Linux at the moment!
- 🎙️ I love to talk about all things technology (and its impact to our society), and urban sustainability!
- 📸 I love film photography!
- 📇 Feel free to reach out on Twitter at @srhvoprog or on LinkedIn (both in bio)!
